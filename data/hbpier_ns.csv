Inconsistent chest-high sets at standout spots in HB and should improve with the incoming tide over the next few hours. Clean conditions.Short-Term Forecast: No big changes as far as surf goes, yet we'll see conditions gradually deteriorate by midday as the tide builds to a 4.8' high at noon and light WSW wind develops. Overall, lower quality through the afternoon so best to take advantage of the morning session."
